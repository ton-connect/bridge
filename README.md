# bridge

[HTTP bridge](https://github.com/ton-connect/docs/blob/main/bridge.md) implementation for TON Connect 2.0.

Bridge v3 is designed for **horizontal scaling** with Redis/Valkey pub/sub architecture, enabling production deployments with high availability and load distribution.

> **Note:** Looking for Bridge v1 (PostgreSQL)? See [`cmd/bridge/README.md`](cmd/bridge/README.md) (deprecated).

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ton-connect/bridge
cd bridge
make build3
./bridge3
```

For production deployments, use Redis/Valkey storage. See [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

Use `make help` to see all available commands.

**Note:** For common issues and troubleshooting, see [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

## üìã Requirements

- Go 1.24+
- Redis/Valkey (or any Redis-compatible storage) for production
- Node.js & npm (for testing)
